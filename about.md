If you came here from the first page I regret to inform you that you've came across the first inaccuracy present in this website (my name is actually (João)). But, even though this one was left on purpose, so that my name could be in compliance with the "unpronounceable names" International Standard, I'm sure there will be many more to come, so if you find any let me know [here](https://github.com/Joe-a-d/joe-a-d.github.io/issues) or drop me an email using the [form](https://joe-a-d.github.io/about/#get-in-touch) below.
